# Retail Demo Store Observability Workshop - Overview

Welcome to the Retail Demo Store Observability Workshop. When developing and running an application, observability is an important factor in evaluating how it performs for your users and quickly identifying and resolving issues. The three primary aspects of observability are logs, metrics, and traces. In this workshop we will explore how we can use Cloudwatch RUM for monitoring how real users are experiencing the website, using traces in X-Ray to track a request through different parts of the application, view the application's logs in Cloudwatch Logs and use [ServiceLens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html) to tie all of this together and provide an end-to-end view of your application.


## How it all works

### Real User Monitoring with Cloudwatch RUM

Cloudwatch RUM allows you to collect and view client-side data about your web application performance from actual user sessions in near real time.  Information gathered includes how users move through the website, errors and performance metrics like page load times.  This can be visualised as is, or broken down by browser, device and location.

### Tracing with X-Ray

AWS X-Ray provides a complete view of requests as they travel through your application and filters visual data across payloads, functions, traces, services, APIs, and more.

The developer adds a snippet of code into the codebase, and information about the request received, how long the response took, errors and calls to downstream services or datastores are sent back to X-Ray. Cloudwatch RUM can also be configured to send information to X-Ray.  The requests are correlated across all services allowing you to view a request through all layers and services.

### Service Map with AWS ServiceLens

Service maps are a visual representation of your application's architecture and the communication between the different components, along with metrics including latency and errors about each component. They show the dependencies that each component has incluing other application components, data stores, and external services.  AWS ServiceLens shows the correlated metrics, logs, and traces associated with that component.

## Next Steps

Now that you have an overview of Observability, we'll work through a more detailed description of each of the components, starting with **[Cloudwatch RUM](./9.1-Cloudwatch-RUM.md)**
